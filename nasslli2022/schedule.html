This question has received intense scrutiny not only in philosophy, but also in mathematical statistics, where a number of results have substantially advanced our understanding of the inherent limits of knowledge. This course will introduce students to some of the most astounding theorems of 20th-century statistics, many of which are not widely known among philosophers.
